# jitsi-docker
Jitsi for docker. 

This will probably not work for most of you if you dont uncomment ports in frontend and remove labels for traefik. 

example.env shoule be renamed to .env and the interface_config.js file should be adjusted for your needs. I removed the watermark and blur function in this one. Delete it for default autocreation. 

Please see official jitsi documentation for help.
